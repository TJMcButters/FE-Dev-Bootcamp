<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Early Career Experience</h2>
<p>My name is Tyler Moncur. I spent 5 years in the United States Marine Corps as an 0231 - or an All Source Intelligence Analyst - in Iwakuni, Japan and Jacksonville, North Carolina. Additionally, while in North Carolina,
  I acquired a Marksmanship Coaching license, meaning I spent much of my time coaching Marines on their rifle shooting abilities, effectively making them better marksmen, and therefore, better Marines.</p>

<h2>Later Career Experience</h2>
<p>After leaving the military, I worked a few odd jobs at Target, CH Robinson - a third party logistics company - and some IT Help Desk jobs to help support myself while I went to college at the University of 
  Northwestern - St. Paul. It was here where I received a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems with an emphasis in Cyber Security. I was quickly hired by Allianz Life US, where I had also interned for 2 Summers, as a 
  Security Consultant. Practically, I was managing the Training, Awareness, and Phishing programs (or TAP, as I like to call it). I continued working successfully for Allianz in this role until 2024 where I transferred
  to another entity within Allianz known as Allianz SE, where I continue to work in the same TAP responsibilities.</p>
